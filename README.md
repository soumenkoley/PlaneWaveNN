# PlaneWaveNN
It contains some matlab porograms for evaluating Newtinian noise at the testmass located in an underground cavity. We consider three cases. Single plane P and S-waves in half space and full space. Third: We also handle the case of a stochastic seismic field produced by interference of many pl;ane P and S-waves.
